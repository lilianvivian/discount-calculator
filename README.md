# Discount Calculator

A Python script that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.

## 💡 How It Works

- The script defines a function `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)`
- If the discount is **20% or more**, it applies the discount
- Otherwise, it returns the original price

## 📥 User Input

Prompts the user to:
1. Enter the original price
2. Enter the discount percentage

Then prints:
- The final price **after applying discount**
- Or the **original price** if no discount is applied

## 📁 File

- `calculate_discount.py`

## 🧪 Sample Output

```
Enter the original price: 1000
Enter the discount percentage: 25
Discount applied. Final price: 750.0
```
